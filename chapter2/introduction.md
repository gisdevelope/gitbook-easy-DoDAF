    1. defines DoD architectural **viewpoints **and **models**
    2. describes the DoDAF **meta-model (DM2)** as it is defined and specified in the **DoD Meta Data Registry (MDR)**.
- The DoD requires architects to use DoDAF 2.0 for **architecture descriptions** because the DoDAF provides a **standard format** for exchanging architectural data.DoDAF concentrates on **data** ,architects must choose their methods and techniques to **create, maintain, and present** architectural data specified by the DoDAF meta-model.
- For convenience of architects and owners of architecture descriptions, we describe some **conventional views** into the DoDAF meta-model of architectural data.
- **Owners of DoD core processes** may determine the architectural data they require from architecture descriptions.
