# Introduction

* DoDAF  Volume 2ï¼Œ
  1. defines DoD architectural **viewpoints **and **models**
  2. describes the DoDAF **meta-model \(DM2\)** as it is defined and specified in the **DoD Meta Data Registry \(MDR\)**.
* The DoD requires architects to use DoDAF 2.0 for **architecture descriptions** because the DoDAF provides a **standard format** for exchanging architectural data.DoDAF concentrates on **data** ,architects must choose their methods and techniques to **create, maintain, and present** architectural data specified by the DoDAF meta-model.
* For convenience of architects and owners of architecture descriptions, we describe some **conventional views** into the DoDAF meta-model of architectural data.
* **Owners of DoD core processes** may determine the architectural data they require from architecture descriptions.Architects should **review** this guidance and comply with these requirements for specific models and views.

# How this volume is organized

This volume contains **information** for **architects** and other technical professionals who develop, use, and maintain architecture.

* Section 1 the **Introduction** to this volume.
* Section 2 presents the DoDAF **meta-model data groups**
* Section 3 describes the **viewpoints** of the DoD architecture framework. Appropriate **models** are described for each of these viewpoints.
* **Appendices** to this volume provide extracts from the DoDAF Glossary.
  * Appendix B identifies and describes the **core terms** of the DoDAF model as these terms are used here.
  * Appendix C identifies and describes **related terms**, such as synonyms for core terms and names for patterns of DoDAF elements.
  * Appendix D discusses the **sources** that were consulted when constructing definitions for core DoDAF terms.
