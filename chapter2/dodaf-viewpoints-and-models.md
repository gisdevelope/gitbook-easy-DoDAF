# DoDAF viewpoints and models

Why viewpoints and models?

* The Department of Defense Architecture Framework \(DoDAF\) has been designed to meet the specific **business and operational needs** of the Department of Defense.

* The DoDAF defines a way of representing an enterprise architecture that enables **stakeholders** to focus on **specific areas of interests** in the enterprise while retaining sight of the **big picture**.

* To **help** decision-makers, DoDAF provides ways to abstract **essential information** from underlying complexity and present this information in ways that maintain coherence and consistency.

* A principal **objective** of DoDAF is to present **this information** in ways that can be understood by many stakeholders who develop, deliver, and sustain capabilities that support missions of the DoD.

* The DoDAF does **this** by dividing a problem space into manageable pieces that correspond to stakeholder **viewpoints**, which are further defined as **models**.

Each viewpoint has its **own purpose**. Each viewpoint usually presents information in one or more of these categories:

1. information that broadly **summarizes** the whole enterprise \(e.g., **high-level operational** concepts\)
2. information that **focuses** narrowly on a special concern \(e.g., **low-level implementation** details\)
3. information that shows **how** elements of an enterprise are **connected** \(e.g., how an activity is **supported** by some system\).

DoDAF organizes models into these viewpoints:

1. The All Viewpoint describes **overarching aspects** of an architecture context that relate to all viewpoints appropriate for the architecture.
2. The Capability Viewpoint describes **capability requirements**, **delivery timing**, and **deployed capabilities**.
3. The Data and Information Viewpoint describes **data relationships** and **alignment structures** in the architecture content for the capability and operational requirements, systems engineering processes, and systems and services.
4. The Operational Viewpoint describes **operational scenarios**, **activities**, and **requirements** that support capabilities.
5. The Project Viewpoint describes **relationships** between **operational and capability requirements** and various **projects** to deliver capabilities. The Project Viewpoint also **details dependencies** among capability and operational requirements, systems engineering processes, systems design, and services design within the **Defense Acquisition System** process.
6. The Service Viewpoint describes the **performers, activities, services, and resources **that provide or support operational, capability, and system functions.
7. The Standards Viewpoint describes **applicable policies, standards, guidance, constraints**, and **forecasts** that shape capability and operational requirements, systems engineering processes, systems, and services.
8. The System Viewpoint describes **systems, their composition, connections, and contexts** that provide or support operational and capability functions.
