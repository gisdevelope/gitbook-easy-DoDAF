* Performers are central to the description of architecture.
  * They are the _**who**_ in architecture descriptions.
  * The _**what**_-activities -are assigned to performers to produce desired effects.
* Performers are futher **subdivided and allocated** to organizations, persons in roles, and systems. Locations and measures are then **applied** to organizations, persons in roles, and systems.
  * Within this assignment and allocation process, there are many **major tradeoff opportunities**.
  * **Automation** \(mechanization versus people\) tradeoffs, analysis for items such as performance and cost/benefit are involved in the process.
* When these tradeoffs and associated decisions are s**ufficiently mature**, an allocated baseline can be declared and an initial **work breakdown structure \(WBS\)** refined.

1. The above figure shows that DoDAF meta-model diagram for the Performers data group.
2. A performer may be:
   1. A **person** in a role such as the roles described by the Army's **military occupational specialities \(MOS\)**.
   2. A **type** of organization or a specific organization that has a mission.
   3. A **system** in the general sense of any assemblage of components-machine and human-that accomplish a function.
   4. A **service**, including software services and business services such as search and rescue.
   5. Any **combination** of the above.
   6. The **performance** of an activity by a performer occurs in physical **space and time**.
   7. In the act of performing the activity. This** **sort of overlap may be expressed by saying that a performer is **assigned** to an activity.
   8. As part of a larger process \(aggregated activities\). This sort of overlap may be by expressed by saying that a performer is **allocated** to an activity.
3. A **standard**, which is a sort of rule, constrains an activity in general and affects how performers carry out activities.
4. A performer may be related to **measures** that bear on the performance of an activity \(e.g., target tracking accuracy\).  A performer may also be related to measures that bear on the performer itself \(e.g., operational condition \).
5. A performer may be at a specific **location** designated by some set if coordinates within a coordinate system. 
6. Activities performed by a system can be called system or service **functions**.
7. In typical uses, activities are named by **verbs** and performers are named by **nouns**.
8. Performers are **represented** in many places and stages in a detailed architecture description.
