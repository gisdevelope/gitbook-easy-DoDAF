* Performers are central to the description of architecture.
  * They are the _**who**_ in architecture descriptions.
  * The _**what**_-activities -are assigned to performers to produce desired effects.
* Performers are futher **subdivided and allocated** to organizations, persons in roles, and systems. Locations and measures are then **applied** to organizations, persons in roles, and systems.
  * Within this assignment and allocation process, there are many **major tradeoff opportunities**.
  * **Automation** \(mechanization versus people\) tradeoffs, analysis for items such as performance and cost/benefit are involved in the process.
* When these tradeoffs and associated decisions are s**ufficiently mature**, an allocated baseline can be declared and an initial **work breakdown structure \(WBS\)** refined.
