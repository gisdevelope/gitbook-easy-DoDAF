# Capability Viewpoint \(CV\)

The Capability Viewpoint describes **capability requirements**, **delivery timing**, and **deployed capabilities**.

1. The Capability Viewpoint **addresses the concerns** of capability portfolio managers.
2. A capability is the ability to cause a **change** in the set of **states** of some **resources**. 
3. Changes in the states of resources are **caused by activities**; a resource in some desired state can only be produced by specified, trainable activities. 
4. Specific activities are chosen to **achieve** effects by **balancing** measures of effect, measures of desire, conditions, rules, and available resources across all desirable effects. This model **focuses** on understanding the capabilities presented by a described architecture in terms that support strategic choices among possible capabilities.
5. Table 3.3-1 names and describes Capability Viewpoint models.
