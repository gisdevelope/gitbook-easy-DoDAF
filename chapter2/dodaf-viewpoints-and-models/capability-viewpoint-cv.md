# Capability Viewpoint \(CV\)

The Capability Viewpoint describes **capability requirements**, **delivery timing**, and **deployed capabilities**.

1. The Capability Viewpoint **addresses the concerns** of capability portfolio managers.
2. A capability is the ability to cause a **change** in the set of **states** of some **resources**. 
3. Changes in the states of resources are **caused by activities**; a resource in some desired state can only be produced by specified, trainable activities. 
4. Specific activities are chosen to **achieve** effects by **balancing** measures of effect, measures of desire, conditions, rules, and available resources across all desirable effects. This model **focuses** on understanding the capabilities presented by a described architecture in terms that support strategic choices among possible capabilities.

## Description that all models have

1. A capability comprises **activities and resources**, which includes resources that are **consumed** by activities, resources that are **produced** by activities, and resources, such as services, that perform activities. A capability is distinguished from other collections of activities and resources by 
   1. \(a\) the explicit **presence of a performer** who       is capable of responsibility and who envisions a desired effect, 
   2. \(b\) explicit **statement and measures** of such desired **effects**, 
   3. \(c\) and explicit **consideration of conditions** under which activities entailed by a capability may be successfully carried out.
2. A responsible **performer** envisions a desired effect. Responsible performers include** types of organizations** and **types of persons** in organizational roles. An effect desired by a responsible performer is some **desired resource state**, that is, some resource state to be achieved by specified **changes** to some set of resources that are **not initially** in the desired state. A desired effect incorporates **three** things:
   1. \(a\) some collection of resources in some **initial state**, 
   2. \(b\) that collection of resources in some **desired state**, and 
   3. \(c\) **measures** of the **differences** between resources in their initial state and their desired state. 

   A capability is also associated with a **measure** of desire to **express how important** it is to a responsible performer to achieve a desired effect. \(Measures of desire may be expressed in ways as varied as priorities, wagers, and budgets.\)
3. A capability **plays out** over **space and time**: resources in **one state** are **transformed** into resources in **another state**. The **location of activities and resources** must be **knowable to ensure** that resources, including performers, are available to activities as they are needed. 
4. Activities are **seen in a CV model** just they are in **other DoDAF models**. An activity **consumes** resources to **produce** resources. Performers, including services, follow guidance, rules, and standards to **carry out** activities.
5. Capabilities, responsible performers, desired effects, resources, activities, services, service descriptions, conditions, measures of effects, and measures of desire **shall be modeled**. Types of locations of resources and activities, rules constraining activities, and additional sorts of measures **may be modeled**. Performers other than responsible performers and services** may be modeled**.

## Capability Effects \(CV-1\)

1. **Description**. This model identifies and describes **effects** caused by capabilities within a described architecture and specifies **measures** for these effects.

2. **Narrative**. This model emphasizes the **desired effects** of capabilities provided by a described architecture.
3. In a CV-1 model, the **emphasis** is on desired effects, which are **articulated** by responsible performers, but details of organizations and organization types are **not modeled**.
4. A desired effect incorporates **three** things:

   * \(a\) some collection of resources in some **initial state**, 
   * \(b\) that collection of resources in some **desired state**, and 
   * \(c\) **measures** of the **differences** between resources in their initial state and their desired state. 

   A capability is also associated with a **measure** of desire to **express how important** it is to a responsible performer to achieve a desired effect. \(Measures of desire may be expressed in ways as varied as priorities, wagers, and budgets.\)

5. **Activities** are seen in CV-1 models just they are in other DoDAF models. In this model, the emphasis is on the **relationship** between activities and capabilities in the production of **desired effects**.

6. **Alternative names**: Vision; Capability Desired Effects.

7. **Notes**. To support **risk management and portfolio management**, a CV-1 model should **examine effects** that are **not desired** as well as effects that are desired.

## Capability Hierarchies \(CV-2\)

1. **Description**. This model identifies and describes one or more **hierarchies of capabilities** provided by an architecture, and it specifies the **types of hierarchical relationships** between these capabilities.
2. **Narrative**. This model emphasizes **relations** among capabilities and among the parts of capabilities.

3. **Activities** are seen in CV-1 models just they are in other DoDAF models. Activities are to be **measured**; collections of **measures** that are applicable to activities should be **grouped as** types of measures of activities.

4. A CV-2 model **shows **

   * \(a\) the **parts** that **make up **a whole capability and 
   * \(b\) the **capabilities** that are **subtypes and subtypes of the capabilities** described by an architecture description.

5. How to **examine** capability：

   * A capability may be examined in terms of its **parts** \(e.g., activities and resources; temporal and spatial states\) **using whole-part relationships**. For example, **understanding** capabilities can be approached by **composition** and by **decomposition** of activities and of resources. 
   * A capability may also be examined in terms of its **similarity and differences** with other capabilities **using super-subtype relationships**. For example, **understanding** capabilities can be approached by **comparing** activities, conditions, resources, desired effects, their measures, their locations, and other sorts of properties shared by different capabilities across their different states. **Capabilities** should be **categorized into types** by such analyses.

7. A CV-3 model emphasizes **looking at** a capability in terms of the **ordering of its temporal parts** using **happensIn** and **beforeAfter** **relationships**. **For example**, understanding capabilities can be approached by **comparing** when things happen in relation to when **other** things happen: what things **come before** and what things **come after**, and what things **happen in synchrony** or **during the same period of time** \(e.g., concurrency; serial and parallel execution and existence\)

6. A CV-4 model emphasizes **looking at** a capability in terms of the **ordering of its temporal parts** using **happensIn** and **beforeAfter** **relationships**. **For example**, understanding capabilities can be approached by **comparing** when things happen in relation to when **other** things happen: what things **come before** and what things **come after**, and what things **happen in synchrony** or **during the same period of time** \(e.g., concurrency; serial and parallel execution and existence\)

3. In the Capability Viewpoint, the emphasis may be on **particular organizations** that desire specified effects and, similarly, **particular organizations** that may be critical to **achieving those effects**. Such particular organizations should be **organizations of the sort** that may have responsibility for those effects.

5. While a CV\_5 model does **not require** exhaustive enumeration of **all possible actual locations** for all possible resources** constituting** a desired effect, **specific known locations** of more-or-less **fixed resources** may be **modeled**.
6. In a CV-5 model, the emphasis is on the **sorts of projects** that might be involved in **delivering the resources** that are parts of a capability and on **temporal measures** appropriate to **understanding the delivery of such resources** \(e.g., schedules; time-lines; budget cycles\). \(To examine specific projects within an architecture description, use the Project Viewpoint.\)
7. In a CV-5 model, the emphasis is on the **temporal parts** of activities—on successive state changes over time—that **produce**
