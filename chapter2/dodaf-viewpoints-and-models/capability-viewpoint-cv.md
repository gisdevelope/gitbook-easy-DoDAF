# Capability Viewpoint \(CV\)

The Capability Viewpoint describes **capability requirements**, **delivery timing**, and **deployed capabilities**.

1. The Capability Viewpoint **addresses the concerns** of capability portfolio managers.
2. A capability is the ability to cause a **change** in the set of **states** of some **resources**. 
3. Changes in the states of resources are **caused by activities**; a resource in some desired state can only be produced by specified, trainable activities. 
4. Specific activities are chosen to **achieve** effects by **balancing** measures of effect, measures of desire, conditions, rules, and available resources across all desirable effects. This model **focuses** on understanding the capabilities presented by a described architecture in terms that support strategic choices among possible capabilities.
5. Table 3.3-1 names and describes Capability Viewpoint models.

## Capability Effects \(CV-1\)

* **Description**. This model identifies and describes **effects** caused by capabilities within a described architecture and specifies **measures** for these effects.
* **Narrative**. This model emphasizes the **desired effects** of capabilities provided by a described architecture.
*  In a CV-1 model, the **emphasis** is on desired effects, which are **articulated** by responsible performers, but details of organizations and organization types are **not modeled**.
* A desired effect incorporates **three** things: \(a\) some collection of resources in some **initial state**, \(b\) that collection of resources in some **desired state**, and \(c\) **measures** of the **differences** between resources in their initial state and their desired state. A capability is also associated with a **measure** of desire to **express how important** it is to a responsible performer to achieve a desired effect. \(Measures of desire may be expressed in ways as varied as priorities, wagers, and budgets.\)
* **Activities** are seen in CV-1 models just they are in other DoDAF models. In this model, the emphasis is on the **relationship** between activities and capabilities in the production of **desired effects**.
* **Alternative names**: Vision; Capability Desired Effects.
*  **Notes**. To support **risk management and portfolio management**, a CV-1 model should **examine effects** that are **not desired** as well as effects that are desired.

## Capability Hierarchies \(CV-2\)

* **Description**. This model identifies and describes one or more **hierarchies of capabilities** provided by an architecture, and it specifies the **types of hierarchical relationships** between these capabilities.
* **Narrative**. This model emphasizes **relations** among capabilities and among the parts of capabilities.

## Capability Schedules \(CV-3\)

* **Description**. This model **identifies** and **describes** **schedules** for the **deployment** of **resources** needed to **realize capabilities** provided by an **architecture**; these schedules are given in terms of **timelines**.
* **Narrative**. This model emphasizes the **temporal parts** of capabilities, specifically the **temporal ordering** of activities that are parts of projects and temporal measures of the availability of resources. 

## Capability Dependencies \(CV-4\)

## Capability Deployments \(CV-5\)

* **Description**. This model **identifies** and **describes** **schedules** for the **deployment** of **resources** needed to **realize capabilities** provided by an **architecture**; these schedules are given in terms of **organizations and locations**.
* **Narrative**. This model emphasizes the **deployment of resources** produced by project activities so that those resources are available to a responsible performer to achieve a desired effect.
