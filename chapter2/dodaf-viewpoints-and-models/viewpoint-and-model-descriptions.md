* The DoDAF viewpoint models may be taken as examples of **ways** to **present architectural data** to **specific audiences** for **specific purposes**.
* DoDAF must be used to **develop architecture descriptions** for the Department of Defense. Owners of **specific** DoDAF architectures may require viewpoint models for their **particular purposes**. Only **rarely would all** viewpoint models be required for any complete DoDAF architecture; rather, the DoDAF is **fit-for-purpose**: presentation requirements are to be **based on decision-maker needs**, not on any set of viewpoint models prescribed by DoDAF fiat. DoDAF does not require architects to use any DoDAF viewpoint models; instead, the DoDAF requires architects to **focus on architectural data** as the foundation for their architectures.
