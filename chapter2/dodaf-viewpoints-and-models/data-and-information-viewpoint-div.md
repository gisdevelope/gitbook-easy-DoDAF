# Data and Information Viewpoint \(DIV\)

The Data and Information Viewpoint describes **data relationships** and **alignment structures** in the architecture content for the capability and operational requirements, systems engineering processes, and systems and services.

1. Data and Information Viewpoint models portray operational and business information requirements and rules that are managed within and used as constraints on operational and business activities. Experience gained from many enterprise architecture efforts within the DoD led to the identification of several levels of abstraction necessary to accurately communicate the information needs of an organization or enterprise. Audience and purpose determine the levels of abstraction that are appropriate for an architecture description. DIV models provide three levels of abstraction—conceptual information, data requirements, and data implementation—that correspond to the conceptual, logical, and physical models familiar to DoD architects.
2. Table 3.4-1 names and describes Data and Information Viewpoint models.
