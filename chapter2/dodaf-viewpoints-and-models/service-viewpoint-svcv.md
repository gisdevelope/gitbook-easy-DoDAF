1. The DoDAF-described Models within the Services Viewpoint describes **services and their interconnections** providing or supporting, DoD functions.
2. DoD functions include both **warfighting and business** functions.

3. The Service Models associate **service resources** to the **operational and capability requirements**. These **resources** support the **operational activities** and facilitate the **exchange of information**.

4.  The **relationship** between **architectural data elements** across the Services Viewpoint to the Operational Viewpoint and Capability Viewpoint can **be exemplified as services** are **procured and fielded to support** the **operations and capabilities of organizations**.

5. The structural and behavioral models in the OVs and SvcVs allow architects and stakeholders to quickly ascertain which functions are carried out by humans and which by Services for each alternative specification and so carry out trade analysis based on risk, cost, reliability, etc.

6. Services are not limited to **internal system functions** and can include **Human Computer Interface \(HCI\)** and **Graphical User Interface \(GUI\)** functions or **functions that consume or produce service data to or from service functions**. The external service data providers and consumers can be used to represent the human that interacts with the service.
