# All Viewpoint \(AV\)

The All Viewpoint describes **overarching aspects** of an architecture context that relate to all viewpoints appropriate for the architecture.

1. All Viewpoint models capture **overarching aspects** of an architecture description. These models provide **information** about the **entire** **architecture description**. AV models provide an **overview** of the architectural effort and may **consider** such things as the scope, context, rules, constraints, assumptions, and derived vocabulary for an architecture description. These models may document the **intent** of an architecture description to help preserve its **continuity** in spite of leadership, organizational, and other **changes** that often occur during a persistent architecture effort.
2. All Viewpoint models are used to **register** architecture descriptions with the Defense of Defense Architecture Repository System \(**DARS**\).
