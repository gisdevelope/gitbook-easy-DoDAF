# Executive Summary

2 "help" and 2 "support":

* The DoDAF helps Department of Defense \(DoD\) managers at all levels **make effective decisions** by sharing information across the Department, Joint Capability Areas\(JCAs\), mission, components, and program.

* The DoDAF helps the DoD Chief Information Officer \(CIO\) **develop and maintain architecture **required by the Clinger-Cohen Act.

* The DoDAF supports **guidance **from the Office of Management and Budget \(OMB\) and other Departmental directives and instructions.

* The DoDAF supports DoD's **core decision-making process**.

DoD Components are expected to **confirm **to the DoDAF when they develop architectures within the Department.

The DoDAF allows **architectural artifacts **to be fit-for-purpose.

The DoDAF focus on **architectural data **rather than architectural artifacts.

> Tools should use the **DoDAF Meta Model** \(DM2\) specifications to exchange architectural data.

Visualizing architectural data is accomplished through **models**.

The DoDAF specification comprises three normative volumes and one informative volume:

* Volume 1，the **manager's** volume, explains the **role** of architecture within core DoD process, and **key DoD architecture concepts** are identified and defined in this Volume.
* Volume 2，the **architect's** volume, 
  * defines architectural **viewpoints **and **model **
  * specifies the **DM2 **at a logical level, as an elaboration of the key concepts identified and defined in Volume 1.
* Volume 3，the **developer's** volume, discusses the **ontologic foundation** for DM2 and specifies the **physical level format** for the exchange of DoDAF-compliant architectural data.
* Volume 4 publishes descriptions of other best practices, lessons learned, and reference documents that **supplement the information** contained in the three normative volumes of the DoDAF.
